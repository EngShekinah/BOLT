## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd MAIN PROJECT/project
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application
To start the development server, run:
```sh
npm run dev
```
This will start the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
The production-ready files will be in the `dist` directory.

### Linting
To lint the code, run:
```sh
npm run lint
```

## System Design

### 4.1 Architecture Overview
The CFHMS project follows a modular architecture with a clear separation of concerns. The main components of the system are:
- **Frontend**: Built with React and TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool.
- **State Management**: Context API is used for managing authentication and notifications.
- **Routing**: React Router is used for client-side routing.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling the application.

### 4.2 Component Structure
The project is organized into various components, each responsible for a specific part of the application. The main directories under `src/components` include:
- **analytics**: Contains components related to analytics and dashboards.
- **auth**: Contains authentication-related components like `AdminRoute` and `ProtectedRoute`.
- **cases**: Manages case-related components.
- **dashboard**: Contains components for the admin dashboard.
- **documents**: Manages document-related components.
- **facilities**: Manages facility-related components.
- **financials**: Manages financial-related components.
- **inventory**: Manages inventory-related components.
- **layouts**: Contains layout components for different user roles.
- **navigation**: Contains navigation components like sidebars and top bars.
- **reports**: Manages report generation components.
- **services**: Manages service-related components.
- **settings**: Manages settings-related components.
- **transportation**: Manages transportation-related components.

### 4.3 Contexts
The project uses Context API for state management. The main contexts are:
- **AuthContext**: Manages authentication state and methods.
- **NotificationContext**: Manages notifications state and methods.

## System Testing and Implementation

### 5.1 Testing Strategy
The CFHMS project uses Jest and React Testing Library for testing. The main testing strategies include:
- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components and functions.
- **Integration Testing**: Testing the interaction between different components.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Testing the entire application flow.

### 5.2 Test Cases
The project includes test cases for various components. Some examples are:
- **AnalyticsDashboard.test.tsx**: Tests for the `AnalyticsDashboard` component.
- **ReportGeneration.test.tsx**: Tests for the `ReportGeneration` component.

### 5.3 Implementation
The implementation of the CFHMS project follows best practices for React development. The main steps include:
- **Setup**: Setting up the project with Vite, React, and TypeScript.
- **Development**: Developing components and features in a modular way.
- **Testing**: Writing and running tests to ensure the quality of the code.
- **Deployment**: Deploying the application to a production environment.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

### 6.1 Conclusion
The CFHMS project is a comprehensive funeral home management system that provides various features for managing cases, services, facilities, transportation, inventory, financials, documents, and reports. The project follows best practices for React development and uses modern tools and libraries for building a scalable and maintainable application.

### 6.2 Recommendations
- **Continuous Integration**: Implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment.
